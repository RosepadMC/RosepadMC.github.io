# Rosepad website released!

Cuz y not

I thought it might be neccessary, nobody said no, and so I did, and now it's here.

Here I might be publishing updates n stuff when I'm bored. This website is pure html and css, and will remain this way for eternity cuz I couldn't be bothered to add ejs to this whole mess.

I might add an RSS feed but no promises.
